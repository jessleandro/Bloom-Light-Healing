      <p>Energy healing is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy systems to remove blocks. By
        breaking through these energetic blocks, the body's inherent ability to heal itself is stimulated.</p>
      <p>We all learned in high school physics class that matter is made up of molecules. Even something that is solid,
        such as a table, is vibrating all the time. As humans, we, too, are vibrating. When you say someone has "good
        vibes," you are really talking about that person's vibrational energyâ€”and happy people tend to vibrate on a
        higher
        frequency.</p>
      <p>Places have vibes too. When you walk into a room in which a fight has just occurred, you may feel a dense
        energy
        that makes you want to leave right away. The beach has a light vibe due to the salt (a natural energy cleanser)
        and moving air. The air at the beach vibrates at a higher frequency as well.</p>
      <p>There are many types of energy healers, and you can find them practically everywhere (You might even be an
        energy
        healer yourself!). One of the oldest and most traditional though is <strong>Reiki</strong>.</p>
